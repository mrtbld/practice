#
# Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such
# that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except
# nums[i].
#
# Example:
#
#     Input:  [1,2,3,4]
#     Output: [24,12,8,6]
#
# Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
#
# Follow up: Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output
# array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity
# analysis.)

    # t:O(nÂ²), s:O(n)

            for j, n in enumerate(nums): # O(n)
                if i != j:
