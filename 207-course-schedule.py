# 207. Course Schedule
#
# There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
#
# Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
# first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
#
# Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it
# possible for you to finish all courses?
#
# Example 1:
#
#     Input: 2, [[1,0]]
#     Output: true
#     Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you
#     should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
#
# Example 2:
#
#     Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
#     Output: false
#     Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you
#     should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have
#     finished course 1. So it is impossible.
#
# Note:
#
# 1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not
#    adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented:
#    https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs
# 2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input
#    prerequisites.
