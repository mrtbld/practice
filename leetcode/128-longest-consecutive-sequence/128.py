        # Leverage hash table constant lookups by turning the list into a set.
        # Then find the sequences starts, i.e. numbers that don't have their N-1
        # in the set. Then for each sequence, get the length by incrementing the
        # starting number as long as the N+1 is in the set. Keep max of those
        # lengths.
        #
        # This is inspired from graph representation of the problem. The set is
        # equivalent to forward and backward adjacency lists of the directed
        # graph in which each node is a number from the list and each edge
        # points to the next number sequentially (i.e. N+1). Each sequence of
        # the list is then a connected component of the graph and the question
        # becomes which one of them has the most nodes.
        #
        # The problem particularities is that there's either zero or one
        # neighbor, i.e. the graph components are linked lists, thus DFS or BFS
        # traversal are not needed; and that which node is the neighbor is know
        # from the node value itself: N+1; there's no need to store that info.
        # Thus real adjacency lists are unneeded and replaced by (N + 1 in set)
        # or (N - 1 in set) for finding forward and backward neighbors,
        # respectively.
