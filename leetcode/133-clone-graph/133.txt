133. Clone Graph

Given the head of a graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node
in the graph contains a label (int) and a list (List[UndirectedGraphNode]) of
its neighbors. There is an edge between the given node and each of the nodes
in its neighbors.

Definition for a undirected graph node

    class UndirectedGraphNode:
        def __init__(self, x):
            self.label = x
            self.neighbors = []
