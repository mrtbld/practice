503. Next Greater Element II

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first
element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The
Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its
traversing-order next in the aray, which means you could seearch circularly to
find its next greater number. If it doesn't exists, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:

    Input: [1, 2, 1]
    Output: [2, -1, 2]
    Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; The number 2 can't
    find next greater number; 1's next greater number needs to search
    circularly, which is also 2.

Note: The length of the given array won't exceed 10000.
